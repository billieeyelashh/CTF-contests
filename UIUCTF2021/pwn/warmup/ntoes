- Vuln is the vulnerarble function. Theres a char buffer of 8 bu the gets function can read in more bytes.
- So we can overwrite anything else after that 8 bytes
- offset seems to be the same always but this has alsr so get the flag address
we overwrite it with the flag address p32(0x80485ab)



0xffffd01c - 0xffffd008(or 0xffffd010) = 0x14 bytes or 0xC bytes
