# Buffer overflow challenge 64bit x86

- main function can read in 32 bytes but doesn't check for more so we can overwrite the saved return address again.
- There is also a function with give shell iwth the adress 0x4005b6
- offset between start of the input and the return adress is 40bytes 32 from the input char after that we have the 8 bytes stack pointer(64bit)

# Steps to take 
1. find out the bytes to overflow the buffer 
2. point to give shell function


# Calculate bytes


0x7fffffffde08 -0x7fffffffdde0 = 0x28

- After 28 bytes I can point to the give shell function


Worked!!

Would not work with stack canaries.
